# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for NLP Tasks

This project implements a simple RNN model using Keras (TensorFlow backend) for two NLP tasks:

1. **Educational Text Classification**: Classifying short educational text snippets into predefined categories (Math, Science, History, English).
2. **Next Word Generation**: Predicting the next 20 words given the beginning of a sentence based on a Science text corpus.


## Dataset

### Educational Text Classification Dataset:
- A dataset of short educational text snippets labeled with categories: Math, Science, History, English.

### Science Corpus for Next Word Generation:
- A text corpus containing educational content on Science to predict the next word in a sequence.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy
