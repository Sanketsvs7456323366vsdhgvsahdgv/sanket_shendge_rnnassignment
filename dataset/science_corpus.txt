Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product. The process is essential for life on Earth as it provides the primary source of energy for nearly all organisms.

Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. They provide structure for the body, take in nutrients from food, and carry out important functions. Cells also contain the bodyâ€™s hereditary material and can make copies of themselves. There are many different types of cells, each performing unique tasks.

The human circulatory system is responsible for the transport of blood, nutrients, gases, and waste products throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns deoxygenated blood back to the lungs for oxygenation.

Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles such as electrons or protons. It is used to power homes, industries, and devices around the world. Electrical circuits allow the flow of electricity, which can be controlled by switches, resistors, and other components.

Gravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses. It is what gives weight to physical objects and causes them to fall toward the Earth when dropped. Isaac Newton formulated the law of universal gravitation, stating that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The periodic table organizes all known chemical elements according to their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements in the same group often have similar properties. The table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.

Sound travels in waves through a medium such as air, water, or solids. It is produced when a source vibrates, causing the surrounding medium to vibrate as well. These vibrations create sound waves, which the human ear interprets as sound.

The Earth is part of the solar system, which includes eight planets that orbit the Sun. The Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun, creating day and night, and the seasons. The moon orbits the Earth and affects ocean tides through gravitational pull.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus. DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive, and reproduce. It is passed from parents to offspring during reproduction.

Vaccination is a method of preventing infectious diseases. Vaccines stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and fight pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. They have significantly reduced or eliminated many deadly diseases, such as smallpox and polio.
